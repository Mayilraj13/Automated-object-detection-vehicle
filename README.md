#  Automated Object Detection Car using IoT

## Project Overview
The Automated Object Detection Car using IoT is a smart robotic vehicle designed to detect and avoid obstacles automatically. The system uses ultrasonic sensors to sense objects in its path and an Arduino Uno to process sensor data and control motor movements. By integrating IoT technology, real-time sensor data can be monitored or transmitted to IoT platforms for analysis and remote supervision.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of robotics, embedded systems, and IoT-based automation for smart mobility solutions.

## Working Principle
1. The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance between the car and nearby objects.
2. The sensor sends distance data to the Arduino Uno.
3. If an obstacle is detected within a predefined range:
   - The Arduino stops the car.
   - Changes direction to avoid collision.
4. Motor movements are controlled using the L298N motor driver.
5. Sensor data can be transmitted to an IoT platform for real-time monitoring and analysis.
