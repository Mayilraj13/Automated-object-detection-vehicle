# 🚗 Automated Object Detection Car using IoT

## 📌 Project Overview
The Automated Object Detection Car using IoT is a smart robotic vehicle designed to detect and avoid obstacles automatically. The system uses ultrasonic sensors to sense objects in its path and an Arduino Uno to process sensor data and control motor movements. By integrating IoT technology, real-time sensor data can be monitored or transmitted to IoT platforms for analysis and remote supervision.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of robotics, embedded systems, and IoT-based automation for smart mobility solutions.
